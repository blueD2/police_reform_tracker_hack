There are a number of valuable ways you can take action to further this cause. While we canâ€™t list them all here, we believe this is a great starting point for anyone who wanted to get involved.


1. Donate your time or money to established projects, such as:

    * [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/)
    * [Campaign Zero](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/)
    * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_police_reforms_related_to_the_George_Floyd_protests)

1. Become a member of an existing organization or activist group. There are people doing great work around the country and some might even be closer than you think:
