The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Atatiana Jefferson and countless others have opened the eyes of our nation. In the wake of these tragedies, a movement was born in streets across the nation. Citizens from every background stood hand-in-hand to let their voices be heard, crying out: “Enough is enough. It’s time for a change!”

As governments begin to enact long-needed change, our goal is to offer a simple and dynamic way to track these statewide police reforms. We want to empower people with knowledge and provide the tools to participate in constructive conversations with others. From kitchen tables to boardrooms, we know the only true way to change minds is with powerful, real time information.

Together, we can erase hatred and create a country that stands for all of us.
